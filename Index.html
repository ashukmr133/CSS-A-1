    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describe how the HTML elements to be displayed on screen, paper, and in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="teststrike">CSS is not nessary</span> <span class="highlight">CSS saves lots of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple webpages at once.</li><br>
        <li class="underline">External style sheet are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
    </ol>
 
    <h2 class="red">CSS can be added to HTML documents in three ways:</h2>
    <ul type="disc" class="space">
        <li>Inline : by using the style atrribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal : byusing the style elements in the head section.</li>
        <li>External : by using a link element tot link to a external CSS file.
        <li>The most common waty to add CSS is, to keep the file in the external CSS file.However <span class="highlight">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier, to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class v/ s Id, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to the multiple elements. ID, on otherhand, applies a styleto one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to the element and it's used by Java scripet.</p>

    <p>In, CSS selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on web pages. Once the element has been targeted,a style or a set of style can be applied to it.</p>

    <p>There is a wide range ods selelctors are avilable. Two of the most commonly used are class and Id. Both are used to target elements to which style should be appied</p>
